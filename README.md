# Object Detection & YOLOs
Real Time object detection is a technique of detecting objects from video, there are many proposed network architecture that has been published over the years.
# YOLOv5 Inferecning using OpenVINO toolkit
The following components are required-

- OpenVINO toolkit
- Model Optimizer - For Openvino toolkit version < 2022.1 , Model optimizer is included in the toolkit. Whereas from 20221. versions onwards, Model optimizer need to be installed seperately.
- System â€“ CPU/ GPU/ VPU
- Python
- ONNX
- Pytorch
- Netron model visualizer
